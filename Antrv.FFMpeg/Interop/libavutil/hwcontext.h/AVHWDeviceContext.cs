/// this struct will (if possible) wrap the state that is common to both encoding
/// and decoding and from which specific instances of encoders or decoders can be derived.
///
/// This struct is reference-counted with the AVBuffer mechanism.The
/// av_hwdevice_ctx_alloc() constructor yields a reference, whose data field
/// points to the actual AVHWDeviceContext.Further objects derived from
/// AVHWDeviceContext (such as AVHWFramesContext, describing a frame pool with
/// specific properties) will hold an internal reference to it.After all the
/// references are released, the AVHWDeviceContext itself will be freed,
/// optionally invoking a user-specified callback for uninitializing the hardware state.
